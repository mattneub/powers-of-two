/*
 This is the basis for our mini-Pentimento modular architecture (see https://livefront.com/pentimento/):

 * A view or view controller is a presenter; the logic goes into the corresponding processor.
 * A view or view controller sends an _action_ to the processor via `receive`, in response to the user.
 * The processor sends a _state_ to the presenter via `present`; the presenter portrays it in the interface.
 * Sometimes the processor may send an _effect_ to the presenter via `receive` to make it perform a
   behavior without the overhead of a state presentation.
