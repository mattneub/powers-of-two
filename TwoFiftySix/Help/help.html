<b>Powers of Two</b> is a clone of <a href="https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048">2048 by Gabriele Cirulli</a>, created in 2014 and still <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/2048-by-gabriele-cirulli/id868076805">available on the App Store</a>. My goal was to write a version without any of the “extras” that have accumulated over the years: no ads, no score, no undo, no sound effects, no power-ups, and completely free and open source.
</p>
<h2>How to Play</h2>
<p>
You are shown a 4x4 game board, with slots for 16 tiles. Every tile displays a numeric value, which is a power of 2: that is, 2, or 4, or 8, and so on. The game begins by randomly producing two tiles, whose values are probably both 2 but possibly 4.
</p>
<p>
You make a move by <b>swiping</b> in one of the four cardinal directions: <b>up, down, left, or right</b>. You don’t have to swipe on the game board; you can swipe anywhere on the screen.
</p>
<p>
The game board responds to your move in the following way:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>
	<b>All</b> the tiles on the board slide as far as possible in the direction that you swiped.
	</li>
	<li>
	During this slide, any pairs of <b>adjacent tiles with the same values</b> (adjacent, that is, along the axis of your swipe direction) are <b>merged</b> into a single tile, whose value is the <b>sum</b> of the values of the original two tiles.
	</li>
	<li>
	The game then randomly produces <b>one</b> new tile, whose value is probably 2 but possibly 4. Now you can make another move.
	</li>
</ol>
<p>
The game <b>ends</b> when you <i>cannot</i> make another move. This would be because all 16 slots are filled with tiles and there are no adjacent same-valued tiles in any swipe direction (so that no merges are possible). At that point, your only option is to tap the New Game button and start over. Alternatively, you can voluntarily tap the New Game button at any time.
</p>
<p>
The <b>object</b> of the game revolves around the merges that can occur during a move. A moment’s thought will reveal that successive merges will produce a tile whose value is the next power of 2: two adjacent 2s become a single 4, two adjacent 4s become a single 8, two adjacent 8s become a single 16, and so on. The goal is to get this number, the value of the <b>highest-numbered tile on the board</b>, to be as high as possible.
</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>512</b> is considered very good.</li>
	<li><b>1024</b> is considered excellent.</li>
	<li><b>2048</b> is considered the best; if you reach it, you have won the game (hence its original name, “2048”). If you reach 2048, you are welcome to play on, but it is extremely unlikely that you would reach a higher tile value, so you should just pat yourself on the back and tap the New Game button.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fine Points</h3>
<p>
During a move, the force of gravity (in the direction of the move) and the power of merging (in the direction of the move) operate simultaneously. For example, a row or column might contain 2, empty, 2, empty; the two 2s are brought together and merged all in one moment, resulting in a single 4 and three empty slots.
</p>
<p>
If a single row or column consists of two adjacent same-valued pairs along the direction of your move (for example: 2, 2, 4, 4), both pairs are merged (and the two merged tiles end up next to each other).
</p>
<p>
If a single row or column contains three adjacent same-valued tiles along the direction of your move (for example: 2, 2, 2), the two tiles furthest in the direction of the move are merged.
</p>
<p>
A tile created by merging during a move cannot be merged again during that move. For example, adjacent tiles 2, 2, 4 in the direction of the move will result in 4, 4; the two 4s are not merged into an 8 on the same move. Of course, you can then move again in the same direction if you wish to merge the new adjacent pair.
</p>
<p>
The hand-waving phrase describing how the game produces new tiles, “probably 2 but possibly 4,” has a well-defined meaning. A new tile is placed into an empty slot completely at random, and its value is randomly 2 or 4 with 2 appearing (on average) nine times out of ten.
</p>
<p>
If you try to move in a certain direction but no move in that direction is possible — all tiles are already positioned as far as possible in that direction, and there are no adjacent same-valued tiles to merge along that axis — then your gesture is considered null and void. There is no move, and no new tile is produced.
</p>
<h2>How to Win</h2>
<p>
The first thing to understand about this game is that you are in a race against the perpetual production of new tiles. The board is trying to fill the board with tiles; you are trying to keep slots open by creating new empty slots. Every merge creates a new empty slot.
</p>
<p>
Moreover, the more empty slots there are, the more random will be the placement of each new tile. To put it the other way round, if at the end of your move there is just one empty slot, the new tile will with 100% certainty appear in that slot, and the only thing in doubt is whether it will be a 2 or a 4. And at that point, if no merge is possible in any direction, the game is over; the board is full and you are stuck.
</p>
<p>
So you can think of empty slots as degrees of freedom. The more of them there are, the more likely it is that when the board produces a new tile, it will be good for you — a useful value in a useful place — and not bad for you.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, if there are too many empty slots, it will be too difficult to create an adjacent pair that you can merge. If you have a 512 tile and a few 2s and an otherwise empty board, then on every move you make, every tile including the 512 runs the risk of moving, and so the probability that you will make <i>another</i> 512 tile adjacent to the first one, so that you can merge them to get 1024, is not high.
</p>
<p>
Moreover, remember that the only values of new tiles that the board will produce are 2s and 4s, predominantly 2s. It is easy to merge two 2s to get a 4 and two 4s to get an 8, but as the numbers get higher, making two adjacent tiles with the same value gets harder. It’s pretty easy to get from 2 to 16 or 32, but it’s a long way from 2 to 512.
</p>
<p>
The solution to these problems is to make a <b>chain</b> — that is, an arrangement of tiles such that each adjacent tile is the previous power of 2. For example, here’s an actual position from a recent game of mine:
</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<img style="display: inline-block; width: 25%; height: 25%;" alt="Screenshot" src="helppix/IMG_2297.PNG">
</div>
<p>
In the above screenshot, I’ve reached a high tile of 512. There are three things to notice:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>The 512 is in the <b>corner</b>. This is good because it means that I can swipe down or left and the 512 will not move; plus, it gives the entire rest of the bottom row to form the chain.</li>
	<li>The entire bottom row is <b>filled</b> with tiles. This good because it means that I can swipe not only down or left but even right, and the 512 will still not move. In fact, none of the tiles in the bottom row will move, unless I am compelled by bad luck or stupidity to swipe up; that would be a disaster as it would probably mess everything up.</li>
	<li>The bottom row is a <b>chain</b>.</li>
</ol>
<p>
The existence of the chain means that if I can somehow make another 64 tile appear where the second 4 tile is now, I can make a <b>series of merges</b>: swipe down to merge the two 64s into a 128 (where the 64 is now), then swipe left to merge the two 128s into a 256 (where the 128 is now), then swipe left to merge the two 256s into 512 (where the 256 is now), then swipe left to merge the two 512s into a 1024.
</p>
<p>
Now, you might say: well, making a 64 tile is not easy either. One solution is to continue the chain. This is the same game, after some more time has passed:
</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<img style="display: inline-block; width: 25%; height: 25%;" alt="Screenshot" src="helppix/IMG_2298.PNG">
</div>
<p>
As you can see, I’ve continued the chain, running the other way in the third row. I’ve managed to make two 8 tiles at the start of the third row, and now I can make a sequence of merges all the way from the two 8 tiles to the 512 tile: swipe right, right, right, down, left, left, left. When I’ve done that, all the tiles in the chain will be gone, and the 512 tile will have turned into 1024 tile:
</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<img style="display: inline-block; width: 25%; height: 25%;" alt="Screenshot" src="helppix/IMG_2299.PNG">
</div>
<p>
Having reached 1024, you might proceed to reach 2048. This is harder to do, and takes quite a bit of time.
</p>
<p>
In the first place, you’ve got more and larger tiles to form in order to make the chain. For example, the first thing you want to do now is to form a 512 tile; and this is going to take you just as long as took you to form the _first_ 512 tile, the one in the first screenshot above. And you’re probably going to do it by forming a chain, which you will then collapse by merges — after which, you’ll have to form another chain in order to make a 256 tile. Similar to the famous Tower of Hanoi puzzle, you keep having to “start over” in order to make each successive tile.
</p>
<p>
The other problem is that your new chain is going to occupy more room in the board. Assuming you can get the initial tiles into the bottom row, the bottom row will consist of 1024, 512, 256, 128. The 64 will then have to go above the 128, and you’re going to have to work the other way across the third row. Meanwhile, all this time, you’re trying not to mess up your existing chain and trying not to run out of moves.
</p>
<p>
All of this takes some care — and quite a bit of luck. The trouble ultimately is that every time the board produces a new tile, you don’t know where it will be and whether it will be a 2 or a 4. The board can thus seriously mess you up at any time.
</p>
<p>
As an example, here’s what actually happened in the same game I’ve been using as an illustration:
</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<img style="display: inline-block; width: 25%; height: 25%;" alt="Screenshot" src="helppix/IMG_2300.PNG">
</div>
<p>
As you can see, things didn’t go entirely according to plan. The fourth row got messed up by a tile in the lower right corner that I couldn’t get rid of (currently a 64), so I had to “turn the corner” on my chain one slot earlier than I wanted to. Things really started piling up on the left side of the board. Nevertheless, as you can, by great good luck, I managed to finish the chain! I’ve got two adjacent 16s in the second row, and now I can make a series of swipes: left, down, right, right, down, left, left — and I reach 2048!
</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<img style="display: inline-block; width: 25%; height: 25%;" alt="Screenshot" src="helppix/IMG_2301.PNG">
</div>
<p>
So that’s my advice for winning the game. Try to make your largest tile in a corner (I like to use the lower left, although sometimes accidents have forced me to settle on a different corner), and occupy the entire edge with tiles so that you can keep your edge tiles where they are. If, as I do, you’re using the bottom edge (row) to hold your main tiles, try very very hard never to swipe up, which might dislodge your main tiles. Form a chain, collapse it to make the next power of 2, and start over.
</p>
<p>
Above all, accept that there’s a major element of luck. At any moment, a tile produced by the board in a bad place can make the best-laid plans go badly awry. Sometimes you can compensate somehow; sometimes you can’t. But 2048 <i>is</i> achievable; if you’re diligent, you should, with practice and experience, be able to get there at least 1/4 of the time.
